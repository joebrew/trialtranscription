<h3 class="section-heading">Barcelonians crash.  A lot.</h3>

<p>Wouldn't it be cool to see all the car accidents on one map?  Yes, that would be awesome.  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/en/2015/12/07/Every-car-accident-in-Barcelona-since-2010.en/">HERE's</a> every Barcelona car accident from 2010 to 2014.</p>

<p>With so many accidents, you might be thinking, "how can I avoid getting in a wreck?" You won't find the answer here, but you might start by avoiding <em>the most dangerous intersection in Barcelona...</em></p>

<h3 class="section-heading">And the winner goes to...</h3>

<p>You guessed it: Avinguda Diagonal and Passeig de Gracia.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">This technically counts as one intersection, right?</span>

<p>From 2010 to 2014, there were 129 accidents involving 165 victims and 248 vehicles. That's an average of one accident every two weeks.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Yikes.</span>


<h3 class="section-heading">But everywhere is kind of dangerous</h3>

<p>The reality is that, relative to other comparable cities, Barcelona is a dangerous place.

Sure, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/3198659/Rome-most-dangerous-city-in-Europe-for-traffic-accidents.html">Rome is worse</a> (who's surprised?), but Barcelona's got a lot of cars, a lot of motorcycles, a lot of old roads, and a lot of people trying to get from point A to point B.  And all that commotion adds up - to an average of 9,235 accidents per year over the last 5 years, which sums up to more than 25 per day.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">And it doesn't appear to be getting any better</h3>



<p>In 2010, there were just a hair over 9,000 accidents.  In 2011, that number dropped to 8,809.  Since then, however, the number of accidents has climbed by a few hundred per year, peaking at 9,660 in 2014 (the last year for which data are available).

<h3 class="section-heading">When do accidents happen?</h3>

As consistent as the yearly numbers are, there's a lot of variation by time and day.  Afternoon is far worse than morning, for example.  In the below chart, you can make out spikes at around 8-9 AM (morning rush hour), 2 PM (afternoon break) and 5-7 PM (evening rush hour).  It's odd that the mid-day spike is so much higher than the morning and evening spikes - are that many people on the road at that time?

<p>Weekdays (especially Friday) are far worse than weekends.</p>

<p>When we look at the averages over the course of an entire week, we see that weekdays have a pre-midnight spike (coming home from dinner), which is conspicuously absent on weekends.</p>

<p>It also seems that most of the Friday spike can be attributed to the AM - not PM - rush.  Strange...</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Like stars in the night sky</h3>

<p>Car accidents are a pretty morbid topic.  They take far too many lives, and cause countless suffering by those affected.</p>

<p>Data visualization can help us to absorb numbers too large for our primate brains (ie, the tens of thousands of car accidents in Barcelona over the last few years, and the hundreds of associated deaths).  So, we'll end this post with a visual: click on the below image and zoom in - white dots are accidents, and red dots are deaths.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Data sources, code, etc.</h3>

<p>OpenDataBCN hosts the <a href="http://opendata.bcn.cat/opendata/ca/catalog/ENTORN_URBA">dataset</a> for traffic accidents managed by the Guardia Urbana.  It's a <em>super</em> interesting dataset with a lot more than what was explored here (mortality, number of injuries, etc.).  </p>

<p>The code and data for this post (including source files, cleaning script, visualizations, etc.) can all be found on <a href="https://github.com/bcndata/accidents_de_cotxe">github</a>.</p>
